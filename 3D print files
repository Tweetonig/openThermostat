I put the 3D print files online for anyone who want to print themself an enclosure for their Open Thermostat. 
You can print your enclosure on a DIY-printer, if you need to find yourself a maker you can find one on the following website: www.3dhubs.com

At 3D Hubs you can upload the STL file you downloaded from Thingiverse and find a maker near you.
